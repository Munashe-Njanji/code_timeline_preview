### Title:

**Code Visualizer: Transforming Code into Engaging Visual Timelines**

### Slogan:

**"See your code come to life!"**

### Description:

This project is a dynamic website that transforms code snippets into visually engaging timelines. Users can easily paste their code into a text field, and the application intelligently analyzes the structure of the code. By applying distinct colors to different code segments—such as keywords, functions, and variables—the visualizer creates an attractive representation that enhances understanding and appreciation of the code's flow. The project aims to make coding more interactive and fun while providing a tool for education and sharing.

### Short Description:

Code Visualizer is a web application that generates colorful visualizations from code inputs, highlighting different segments for improved readability and engagement. The tool will soon feature dark mode for better usability in low-light conditions and the ability to export visualizations as images for easy sharing.
